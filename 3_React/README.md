# [ REACT ] -- SKWLNotes-webdev

### What is React?
* React code is written in "JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript". This allows us to manipulate and create html code with the power of essentially JavaScript commands.
* Hence, we can render a html document or a collection of html documents with React.

* React carries a "lightweight representation" of the html document, and then uses references to manipulate specific sections of the document.	

### Key Vocabulary
* ***"JSX":*** a syntatic extension of JavaScript.
* ***"ReactDOM":*** React's rendering API that allows us to render content to the DOM while using only JSX, as seen here
	
	```
	ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))
	```
	"You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node to render them to."
