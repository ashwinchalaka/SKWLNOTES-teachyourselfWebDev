### What is JavaScript?
* Adds the dynamic quality to websites in real time

* 3 defining characteristics
	1. JavaScript is an intepreted language
		* Converted into machine language at runtime, rather than before
	2. JavaScript is an event-driven language
		* As a user interacts with html elements, events are triggered and those events are linked to scripts
	3. JavaScript is run on a single thread
		* Only one event script is executed at a time, however the JavaScript uses an event loop and a queue to manage all the events that are triggered even if they are concurrent
